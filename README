Hello!


Instructions:
1. run ./configure
2. run make
3. run ./osc_sharp
4. connect the oscillator to your output device using jack
5. use the mouse to control the frequency of the phasor 


(The mouse position height and width percentage relative to your display size will modulate the frequency of phi_x and phi_y, respectively)

Moving the mouse side to side (widthwise) results in cool harmonics!
